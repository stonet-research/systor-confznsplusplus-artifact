# ZINC - A ZNS Interference-aware NVMe Command Scheduler

This repository contains ZINC, an I/O scheduler for ZNS, and a ZNS command (I/O and management) interference study.
Despite ZNSâ€™s promises, with the benchmarks (micro- and macro-level workloads) we identify that the new ZNS commands create complex interference patterns with I/O and each other that lead to significant losses in application performance.
We introduce a first-of-its-kind interference model ([`interference_model`](./interference_model/quantification.py)) for ZNS to quantify and study the interference overheads of ZNS.
Based on our interference study, we propose ZINC, a ZNS interface-aware NVMe command scheduler that mitigates the impact of interference by prioritizing user I/O commands over flash management commands (configurable).

## Dependencies and build instructions

All of our experiments utilize the `io_uring NVMe passthrough` functionality, which requires a modern Linux kernel (>6).
Additionally, our scheduler is built on `Linux 6.3.8`, so we recommend using `Linux 6.3.8` of the Linux kernel for reproducability.
Note that all our benchmarks require using a custom version of fio (`tools/fio`).

### Build fio

Our micro benchmarks use fio.
Building the custom fio requires no modifications over the conventional fio building process:

```bash
pushd tools/fio
./configure
make -j
popd
```

### Build ZenFS

Our macro benchmarks use ZenFS. To build ZenFS run:

```bash
pushd tools/rocksdb
DEBUG_LEVEL=0 ROCKSDB_PLUGINS=zenfs make -j db_bench
sudo DEBUG_LEVEL=0 ROCKSDB_PLUGINS=zenfs make install
cd plugin/zenfs/util
make
popd
```

### Plotting/interference model requirements

Both our interference model and our plotting scripts use Python. The interference model and `plot.py` scripts have the requirements specified in `requirements.txt`, the notebooks have the requirements specified in `requirements-jupyter.txt`.
Install the dependencies with `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` and `pip3 install -r requirements-jupyter.txt` respectively.

### Build ZINC

Note, building ZINC is not necessary for the interference study!
ZINC requires the code of the [6.3 Linux](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/tree/v6.3/block) block layer. In order to build and install the ZINC scheduler a couple of steps are needed. These include cloning Linux 6.3, copying the ZINC files (`zinc.c` and `Makefile`) into the block layer, and building the ZINC scheduler.

```bash
cd zinc-scheduler

# Setup Linux (only do once)
git clone https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git linux-6.3.8
pushd linux-6.3.8
git checkout v6.3
# We need to build part of Linux in order to build the scheduler. You can control+C once the relevant files are initialized
cp /usr/src/linux-headers-$(uname -r)/.config .config
scripts/config --disable SYSTEM_TRUSTED_KEYS
scripts/config --disable SYSTEM_REVOCATION_KEYS
make menuconfig
make -j10 bindeb-pkg LOCALVERSION=-local
popd
rm *.deb

# Compile ZINC (Repeat everytime ZINC is changed)
sudo rmmod zinc
cp Makefile linux-6.3.8/block/
cp zinc.c linux-6.3.8/block/
pushd linux-6.3.8/block/
# Make module
make
# Install the module
sudo insmod zinc.ko
popd
```

## Run micro interference experiments

In order to run our micro benchmarks for one namespace, change the directory to `./zns-command-interference/microbenchmarks/one-namespace`.
For each type of interference benchmark there is a separate dir, for example "finish on reset interference" is in `finish-on-reset-interference`. Running a benchmark is equal to:

```bash
# Run the benchmark
./bench nvmexny 
# Get the data of the benchmark
cat data/*
# Plot the data of the benchmarks and get the interference value ($Z^{Inter}$) of our model
python3 ./plot.py
```

For experiments with `finish` it is necessary to specify the amount of zones that will be used for finishing zones.
We recommend setting this to ~30% of the zones. We picked the number of zones with the following reasoning:

```
For the evaluated SSDs finish commands are completed at ~1 finish/sec. With a 50% rate limit we can do 1 finish every 2 seconds 
and for benchmarks we try to run for 10 minutes (10*60/2) = 300 and peak write bandwidth is 1.2GB/s = ~1 zone so within 10 
minutes we can fill (10*60) = 600 and we have a total of 904 zones
```

## How to use ZINC

After the `zinc.ko` module is installed (`sudo insmod zinc.ko`), it can be set in on any NVMe device as follows:

```bash
# Replace nvme*n* with nvme device name
echo zinc | sudo tee /sys/block/nvme*n*/queue/scheduler
```

## Reproducing [paper] Results

The [`paperplots notebook`](./plotting-notebooks/paperplots.ipynb) contains all plotting scripts, with the respective data, for all figures used in the paper.

## Directory Structure

This repository is broken down into several distinct directories and subdirectories, which are organized as follows:

- [`interference_model`](./interference_model/) contains the python lib of the presented quantification model, to be imported into data parsing scripts to calculate the $Z^{Inter}$ value.
- [`plotting-notebooks`](./plotting-notebooks/) contains all plotting scripts, as jupyter notebooks, for generating figures.
- [`tools`](./tools/) contains the custom `fio` and `ZenFS` repositories for generating all micro- and macro-level benchmarks of this study.
- [`zinc-benchmarks`](./zinc-benchmarks/) contains all the benchmarking scripts and collected data for the benchmarks (micro- and macro-level) run on ZINC.
- [`zinc-scheduler`](./zinc-scheduler/) contains the source code of ZINC.
- [`zns-command-interference`](./zns-command-interference) contains all interference workloads run throughout the study. Each workload has its own subdirectory, with a benchmarking script to run the workload (run `./bench nvme0n2` on the respective device), all our collected data sets, and each workload has a plotting script to generate standalone figures apart from the paper figures (run `python3 plot.py`).
- [`util`](./util/) contains utility scripts used throughout this study, which are typically called from other benchmarking scripts.
